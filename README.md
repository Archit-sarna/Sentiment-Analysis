# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis Project
Overview
Sentiment Analysis, also known as Opinion Mining, is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in text data, which can be positive, negative, or neutral. This GitHub project provides a comprehensive sentiment analysis solution, offering a range of models and information about different approaches to sentiment analysis.

Key Features
Text Preprocessing: The project includes robust text preprocessing techniques, such as lowercasing, punctuation removal, and stop word removal, to prepare text data for sentiment analysis.

Sentiment Classification Models: This project offers a choice of powerful machine learning models:

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) known for its ability to capture long-term dependencies in text data.
RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): Another sequential model often used for sentiment analysis and sequence data.
CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): A deep learning architecture that can be used for text analysis by treating text as a one-dimensional image.
Logistic Regression: A classic machine learning algorithm for binary classification that can serve as a baseline for sentiment analysis.
About LSTM, RNN, CNN, and Logistic Regression
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM is a type of RNN architecture designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, enabling it to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data like text. It is particularly effective for sentiment analysis due to its ability to consider context over longer stretches of text.

RNN (Recurrent Neural Network): RNNs are a class of neural networks that process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that evolves as new tokens are processed. While simple, they can be used for sentiment analysis and other sequence-based tasks.

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): Originally designed for image analysis, CNNs can be adapted for text analysis by treating text as a one-dimensional image. They use convolutional layers to capture local patterns in the data.

Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression is a classic machine learning algorithm for binary classification tasks. It serves as a simple yet effective baseline for sentiment analysis tasks.
